More than 600 men arrested and detained by the Yemeni authorities are now awaiting deportation. The conditions in which armed soldiers prevent them from leaving the makeshift prison depot are becoming increasingly desperate. A few days ago, the authorities stopped distributing food and basic supplies that I had. They came from Djibouti to work, they were giving us a small amount of food, if there was no food we would die. An immigrant, who asked not to be named, said that if there was no solution, they would either deport us back to our country or take us out of here. Yemen, the poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula, has long been a springboard for East African migrants and refugees, many of whom are fleeing hunger and violence.

Deporting migrants to their countries of origin says that up to 15,000 migrants are arrested at city checkpoints each month. A Health Ministry official told Reuters that the move to the new facility aims to improve conditions for migrants awaiting deportation. Saudi Arabia and a coalition of mostly Gulf Arab states are working to restore power to the Yemeni government in exile and nominal control of the region. Aden and other southern areas contain the Iran-aligned Houthi group. Tight budgets and competition with local armed groups mean that their officials often live abroad.

,"Most of them come from the poor horns of Africa, and every year tens of thousands of people go to war-torn poor Yemen in hopes of finding a job in Saudi Arabia and other wealthy Gulf Arab countries. I want to step in, but their plans aren't. More than 600 men arrested and detained by Yemeni authorities are currently awaiting deportation. The situation that prevents armed soldiers from leaving the makeshift prison is becoming more and more desperate. A few days ago, authorities stopped distributing the food and basic supplies I had. They came to work from Djibouti and gave us a small amount of food if we had no food to die. Immigrants who asked not to be nominated said they would either deport us to our country or take us out of here if there was no solution. Yemen, the poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula, has long been the starting point for East African migrants and refugees fleeing hunger and violence. Despite these risks, according to UNHCR local official Khaled Al-Alwani, the number of migrants entering Yemen across the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea increased from 92,000 in 2015 to 2016 in 2016, according to UNHCR. It is steadily increasing in the year. Deportation of migrants to their country of origin will result in the arrest of up to 15,000 migrants at city checkpoints each month. Health officials told Reuters that the move to the new facility aims to improve the status of migrants awaiting deportation. A coalition of Saudi Arabia and predominantly Gulf Arab countries is working to restore power to the Yemeni government in asylum and nominal control of the region. Adento and other southern regions include the Houthi Group, which has formed an alliance with Iran. Tight budgets and competition with local armed groups mean that their officials often live abroad. National services and wages have been hit hard by the turmoil, and immigrants from Africa appear to be a secondary priority.
